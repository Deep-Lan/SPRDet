# SPRDet
The software product, known as "deep learning-based surface plasma resonance excitation angle detection software", was developed for users engaged in nano-optical detection technology, especially in the extraction of 2D SPR excitation angle features. The commonly used SPR coupling methods mainly include prismatic and high numerical aperture microscope. In the high numerical aperture mirror-type SPR coupling mode, the characteristics of the best excitation angle are represented by a set of symmetrical absorption arcs/circles formed on the focal surface behind the orthophoto, so it is important to precisely locate the position of the absorption arc/circle to extract the feature value.
The software provides a complete solution for the detection of 2D SPR absorption spectral excitation angles. The solution process is as follows: input the back focal plane image (back focal plane, BFP) into the trained Faster R-CNN neural network, obtain the classification and rough position size information of the through aperture and SPR absorption spectrum, and then use the minimum error method to segment the BFP image, and use the image two-dimensional convendulation method to accurately the split image. To determine the through-light aperture and SPR absorption spectral center position, and then combined with the rough position size information provided by the neural network to make radius grayscale statistics on the BFP image, respectively, to determine the through-light aperture and SPR absorption radius size, and finally, the numerical aperture NA and refractive index n by the Abe sine formula to calculate the SPR excitation angle.
